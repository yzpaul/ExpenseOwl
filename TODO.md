BUG
* category defaults overwrite existing on save???
* 3+ splits not delete on close and not add properly
* in splits category is not a dropdown

TODO
* pass selected month between screens
* Add "year so far" pie chart
* option to zero out catalog when importing records
* dedup entries on import
* add transaction comments
* Date UTC import truncate hours instead of guessing and reconverting if present

DONE
* allow negatives (for better CC statement handling)
* When pressing edit the edit box opens below the row instead of at the top
* Display error messages for skipped records
* Category edits now only require one button (not both save and apply)
* need split transaction option (with total display)
